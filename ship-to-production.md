# Ship To Production

The primary method by which you can release Holochain apps at the moment is via a system known as the [Holochain Launcher](https://github.com/holochain/launcher). This system is a whole application in itself, which allows end users to download and install Holochain apps, and execute them in different Holochain runtimes (it can run multiple versions of Holochain simultaneously).&#x20;

You can learn about packaging an application up for use in the Holochain Launcher [here](https://github.com/holochain/launcher#packaging-a-web-happ).

One strategy for having a Holochain Launcher ready project set up easily is to use these instructions on the Holochain developer documentation: [https://developer.holochain.org/happ-setup/](https://developer.holochain.org/happ-setup/)
